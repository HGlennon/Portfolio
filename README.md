# My Portfolio

This is my portfolio website that was created primarily with [React](https://react.dev/) and [CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html) in order to show my skillset, projects, education and achievements. I am constantly adding to it with new accomplishments as time passes so look out for those! The layout for this website was also inspired by https://brittanychiang.com/, due to its simplicty and ability to easily convey information. However, the code for this portfolio is entirely my own.
